# Year 3 Concurrent Programming Coursework: Ticketing Machine

This coursework project involves creating a ticketing machine using multithreading concepts. The project is developed to demonstrate concurrent programming techniques. Additionally, `.lts` files are provided, which can be used with the LTSA (Labelled Transition System Analyser) tool from Imperial College London to visualize the process of the machine.

## Features

- **Multithreading:** Implements a ticketing machine using concurrent programming to handle multiple threads.
- **LTSA Visualization:** `.lts` files included for process visualization using the LTSA tool.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** For implementing the multithreading ticketing machine.
- **LTSA Tool:** For visualizing the process (requires LTSA from Imperial College London).
